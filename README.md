 The ATMSystem is the project which is used to access their bank accounts in
 order to make cash withdrawals. Whenever the user need to make cash
 withdraws, they can enter their PIN number (personal identification number)
 and it will display the amount to be withdrawn in the form of 50's, 100's and
 500's. Once their withdrawn was successful, the amount will be debited in their
 account.
 The ATMSystem is developed in VB.Net and back-end database as Ms-Access.
 VB.Net is the one of the powerful version of Framework and object oriented
 programming, Hencewe use this software in our project.
 The ATMwill service one customer at a time. A customer will be required to
 enter ATM Card number, personal identification number (PIN)- both of which
 will be sent to the database for validation as part of each transaction. The
 customer will then be able to perform one or more transactions. Also customer
 must be able to make a balance inquiry of any account linked to the card.
 The ATMwill communicate each transaction to the database and obtain
 verification that it was allowed by the database. In the case of a cash
 withdrawal, a second message will be sent after the transaction has been
 physically completed (cash dispensed or envelope accepted). If the database
 determines that the customer's PIN is invalid, the customer will be required to
 re-enter the PIN before a transaction can proceed.
 If a transaction fails for any reason other than an invalid PIN, the ATM will
 display an explanation of the problem, and will then ask the customer whether
 he/she wants to do another transaction.
 The ATMwill provide the customer with a printed receipt for each successful
 transaction, showing the date, time, machine location, type of transaction,
 account(s), amount, and ending and available balance(s) of the affected account
 ("to" account for transfers).
